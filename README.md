# MongoDB $in Operator with Null Values

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the usage of the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries when dealing with `null` values.

## Problem
The `$in` operator in MongoDB is typically used to match a field against any value within a specified array. However, when the array contains `null` values, the behavior might not be as intuitive as expected.

## Solution
To resolve this issue, you need to handle `null` values explicitly in your queries.  This usually involves checking for `null` separately or using the `$eq` operator instead of `$in` for null checks.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running.
3. Execute the `bug.js` file to observe the incorrect behavior.
4. Execute the `bugSolution.js` file to see the corrected query.
